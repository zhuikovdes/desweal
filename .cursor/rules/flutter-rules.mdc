You are an expert in Flutter, Dart, Bloc, Freezed, Flutter Hooks, and Firebase.

# Key Principles
  - Write concise, technical Dart code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns where appropriate.
  - Prefer composition over inheritance.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported widget, subwidgets, helpers, static content, types.
    
# Dart/Flutter
  - Use const constructors for immutable widgets.
  - Leverage Freezed for immutable state classes and unions.
  - Use arrow syntax for simple functions and methods.
  - Prefer expression bodies for one-line getters and setters.
  - Use trailing commas for better formatting and diffs.
    
# Error Handling and Validation
  - Implement error handling in views using SelectableText.rich instead of SnackBars.
  - Display errors in SelectableText.rich with red color for visibility.
  - Handle empty states within the displaying screen.
  - Manage error handling and loading states within Cubit states.
    
# Bloc-Specific Guidelines
  - Use Cubit for managing simple state and Bloc for complex event-driven state management.
  - Extend states with Freezed for immutability.
  - Use descriptive and meaningful event names for Bloc.
  - Handle state transitions and side effects in Bloc's mapEventToState.
  - Prefer context.read() or context.watch() for accessing Cubit/Bloc states in widgets.
    
# Firebase Integration Guidelines
  - Use Firebase Authentication for user sign-in, sign-up, and password management.
  - Integrate Firestore for real-time database interactions with structured and normalized data.
  - Implement Firebase Storage for file uploads and downloads with proper error handling.
  - Use Firebase Analytics for tracking user behavior and app performance.
  - Handle Firebase exceptions with detailed error messages and appropriate logging.
  - Secure database rules in Firestore and Storage based on user roles and permissions.
    
# Performance Optimization
  - Use const widgets where possible to optimize rebuilds.
  - Implement list view optimizations (e.g., ListView.builder).
  - Use AssetImage for static images and cached_network_image for remote images.
  - Optimize Firebase queries by using indexes and limiting query results.
    
# Key Conventions
  1. Use GoRouter or auto_route for navigation and deep linking.
  2. Optimize for Flutter performance metrics (first meaningful paint, time to interactive).
  3. Prefer stateless widgets:
     - Use BlocBuilder for widgets that depend on Cubit/Bloc state.
     - Use BlocListener for handling side effects, such as navigation or showing dialogs.
    
# UI and Styling
  - Use Flutter's built-in widgets and create custom widgets.
  - Implement responsive design using LayoutBuilder or MediaQuery.
  - Use themes for consistent styling across the app.
  - Use Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleLarge instead of headline6, and headlineSmall instead of headline5 etc.
    
# Model and Database Conventions
  - Include createdAt, updatedAt, and isDeleted fields in Firestore documents.
  - Use @JsonSerializable(fieldRename: FieldRename.snake) for models.
  - Implement @JsonKey(includeFromJson: true, includeToJson: false) for read-only fields.
    
# Widgets and UI Components
  - Create small, private widget classes instead of methods like Widget _build....
  - Implement RefreshIndicator for pull-to-refresh functionality.
  - In TextFields, set appropriate textCapitalization, keyboardType, and textInputAction.
  - Always include an errorBuilder when using Image.network.
    
# Miscellaneous
  - Use log instead of print for debugging.
  - Use BlocObserver for monitoring state transitions during debugging.
  - Keep lines no longer than 80 characters, adding commas before closing brackets for multi-parameter functions.
  - Use @JsonValue(int) for enums that go to the database.
    
# Code Generation
  - Utilize build_runner for generating code from annotations (Freezed, JSON serialization).
  - Run flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs after modifying annotated classes.
    
# Documentation
  - Document complex logic and non-obvious code decisions.
  - Follow official Flutter, Bloc, and Firebase documentation for best practices.
